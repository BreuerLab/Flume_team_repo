FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE RUN_MOTORS CODE
(2022 06 23)

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 >> From the "out" variable:
 - Cols 1 to 6 = pitching and heaving positions for the three rigs (starting with the foremost upstream)
               1 --> Shawn   pitching (defunct)
               2 --> Shawn   heaving  (defunct)
               3 --> Gromit  pitching (leading) [rad]
               4 --> Gromit  heaving  (leading) [m]
               5 --> Wallace pitching (trailing) [rad]
               6 --> Wallace heaving  (trailing) [m]
 - Cols 13 to 16 = vectrino data.
               13 --> x flow velocity [m/s]
               14 --> y flow velocity [m/s]
               15 --> z1 flow velocity [m/s]
               16 --> z2 flow velocity [m/s]
 - Cols 17 to 22 = Leading foil data:
               17 --> normal force (Fy) [N]
               18 --> tangential force (Fx) [N]
               22 --> spanwise torque (Tz) [N]
 - Cols 7 to 12 = Trailing foil data:
                7 --> normal force (Fy) [N]
                8 --> tangential force (Fx) [N]
               12 --> spanwise torque (Tz) [N]

 >> From the "Prof_out_angle" variable:
 - Cols 1 to 6 = pitching and heaving positions for the three rigs (starting with the foremost upstream)
               1 --> Shawn   pitching (defunct)
               2 --> Shawn   heaving  (defunct)
               3 --> Gromit  pitching (leading) [deg]
               4 --> Gromit  heaving  (leading) [m]
               5 --> Wallace pitching (trailing) [deg]
               6 --> Wallace heaving  (trailing) [m]
